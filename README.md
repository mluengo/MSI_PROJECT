# MSI_PROJECT
Python scripts used in the MSI project Molecular dynamics of ùõÇ-synuclein in complex with Œ≤-wrapin AS69

* changeIDs. py: script to change the atom index to be unique. 
* recount_contacts.py: store data from Timeline tool from VMD and plot frame - number of contacts at a given temperature. 
* recount_contacts_all.py: store data from Timeline tool from VMD and plot frame - number of contacts for 6 different temperatures. 
* recount_contacts_AB.py: store data from Timeline tool from VMD and plot frame - number of contacts for 6 different temperatures for water (solid line) and vacuum (dashed line).
* recount_contacts_AC.py: store data from Timeline tool from VMD and plot frame - number of contacts for 3 different temperatures for the wt (solid lines) and the mutated (set1) (dashed lines). 
* recount_contacts_mut.py: store data from Timeline tool from VMD and plot frame - number of contacts at 25¬∫C for the wt (solid lines) and the mutated set 1 and set2.
